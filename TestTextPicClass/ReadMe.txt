clsTextPic - Display formatted text on tiled image backgrounds

This class was designed to help someone create a formatted text (rich-text-like) display featuring tiled image backgrounds that was smooth and fast. Though someone can easily create a custom control from this, I did not need for it to go that far. Features:  Any font style and size and color supported, indenting, hanging indents, smooth scrolling, single or tiled background image, and more. It was too useful to keep just to myself.
